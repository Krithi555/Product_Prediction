# Product_Prediction
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Amazon's product during non sale period and festival time, with a focus on pricing dynamics. Through the application of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, the data will be categorized based on a predetermined price threshold. The study encompasses preprocessing, feature extraction, and SVM training phases, aiming to reveal connections between festival periods and product prices, shedding light on potential consumer behavior patterns. Rigorous evaluation and possible parameter optimization of the SVM model will enhance accuracy. Ultimately, this endeavor seeks to provide data-driven insights into the impact of festivals on Amazon product pricing, facilitating informed decision-making in the realm of e-commerce
